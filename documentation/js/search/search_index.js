Navigate to http://localhost:8080/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nnpm run build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the docs/meteo-station directory.\nTest the build\nnpm run build-test to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the docs/meteo-station directory.\nIt will serve at : http://localhost:8081/ \nGenerate Documentation & serve it\nnpm run load-doc to build the documentation into documentation directory\nIt will serve at : http://localhost:8082/\nDeploy on a server\nTake the content of docs/meteo-station & copy it into a specific directory (ex : /www/meteo-station/...) on a HTTP server (ex : OVH, 1&1 or other, ...  ) to serve it.\nYou can access application by your specific url with a sub domain (ex : http://meteo-station.mysite.com ) that points to your specific
